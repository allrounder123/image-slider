1️⃣ HTML Structure
<h1>IMAGE SLIDER</h1>
<div class="center-box">
    <img id="pic" src="./comp1img.jpeg" alt="computer desktop picture" />
    <div>
        <button onclick="next()">next</button>
        <button onclick="prev()">previous</button>
    </div>
</div>


<h1>: The title “IMAGE SLIDER”.

<div class="center-box">: Container that centers everything using CSS.

<img id="pic" ...>: The main image shown in the slider. The id="pic" allows JavaScript to target this image.

<button onclick="next()">: Clicking this button calls the next() function.

<button onclick="prev()">: Clicking this button calls the prev() function.

2️⃣ JavaScript Variables
const images = [
    "./comp1img.jpeg",
    "./comp2image.jpeg",
    "./comp3image.jpeg",
    "./comp5img.jpeg",
    "./comp6img.jpeg",
    "./comp7img.jpeg"
];


images is an array that stores all the image file paths.

const means it cannot be reassigned, but you can still access the elements inside it.

Each element in the array corresponds to an image in your project folder.

let currentIndex = 0;
currentIndex tracks which image is currently being displayed.
Starts at 0, which means images[0] (./comp1img.jpeg) is shown first.

const pic = document.getElementById("pic");
pic is a reference to the <img> element in the HTML.

We use pic.src = ... later to change the image being displayed dynamically.

3️⃣ The next() Function
function next() {
    currentIndex++;  // move to the next image
    if (currentIndex >= images.length) {
        currentIndex = 0; // if we go past the last image, loop back to the first
    }
    pic.src = images[currentIndex]; // change the image shown in the <img> tag
}


Step by step:

currentIndex++ → increases the index by 1.

If currently showing images[2], currentIndex becomes 3.

if (currentIndex >= images.length) → checks if we have moved beyond the last image.

images.length = 6 (because there are 6 images).

If currentIndex is 6 (past the last index 5), it resets to 0.

pic.src = images[currentIndex] → updates the <img> element to show the new image.

✅ Effect: Clicking “next” cycles forward through the images, looping back to the first image after the last.

4️⃣ The prev() Function
function prev() {
    currentIndex--;  // move to the previous image
    if (currentIndex < 0) {
        currentIndex = images.length - 1; // if we go before the first image, loop to the last
    }
    pic.src = images[currentIndex]; // update the image
}


Step by step:
currentIndex-- → decreases the index by 1.

If currently showing images[2], currentIndex becomes 1.

if (currentIndex < 0) → checks if we moved before the first image.

If currentIndex is -1, it sets currentIndex = images.length - 1 → shows the last image.

pic.src = images[currentIndex] → updates the <img> element with the correct image.

✅ Effect: Clicking “previous” cycles backward through the images, looping to the last image if currently at the first.

5️⃣ How the Slider Works Overall

The <img> tag always displays the image at images[currentIndex].

Clicking “next” or “previous” updates currentIndex appropriately.

The if conditions handle looping, so you can cycle infinitely in either direction.
